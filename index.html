          <p>Upon graduation from the U.S. Air Force Academy, I served as an Air Force Logistics Readiness Officer for 16 years.  During my time in the Air Force, I had an incredible opportunity to live overseas in Germany, Japan and Korea and travel around the world.  These adventures challenged me to get out of my comfort zone and afforded me the chance to learn about new cultures and meet people from around the globe.  Of course, it also gave me the chance to eat some incredible food along the way!  Four years ago, I retired from the military and transitioned to work in the finance industry.  I have held multiple roles in Bank of Americaâ€™s Global Technology and Operations, which gave me a strong desire to learn about information systems and, more specifically, how to code.</p>
